# Customer Churn Prediction Model

## Project Architecture

This project will implement a customer churn prediction model using PySpark for ETL and model training, MLflow for experiment tracking and model retraining, and ensemble methods for improved accuracy. ITIL-compliant logging and backup structures will be integrated.

### Components:

1.  **Data Ingestion & ETL (PySpark):**
    *   Reads raw customer data from various sources (e.g., CSV, Parquet, databases).
    *   Performs data cleaning, transformation, and feature engineering using PySpark DataFrames.
    *   Prepares data for model training and inference.

2.  **Model Training & Evaluation (PySpark MLlib & Ensemble Methods):**
    *   Utilizes PySpark MLlib for building and training machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests).
    *   Implements ensemble methods (e.g., Bagging, Boosting, Stacking) to combine multiple models and enhance prediction accuracy.
    *   Evaluates model performance using appropriate metrics (e.g., Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, AUC-ROC).

3.  **MLflow Integration:**
    *   Tracks experiments, parameters, metrics, and models using MLflow.
    *   Enables versioning and reproducibility of models.
    *   Facilitates automated model retraining based on new data or performance degradation.

4.  **Logging & Monitoring (ITIL-compliant):**
    *   Implements structured logging for ETL processes, model training, and inference.
    *   Captures key operational metrics and errors.
    *   Ensures logs are stored in a centralized, accessible, and secure location.

5.  **Backup & Recovery:**
    *   Establishes procedures for backing up trained models, data pipelines, and configuration files.
    *   Defines recovery strategies to ensure business continuity.

## Dependencies:

*   Apache Spark (with PySpark)
*   MLflow
*   Python (with necessary data science libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn for local testing/preprocessing)
*   Hadoop/S3 (for data storage, if applicable)
*   Logging framework (e.g., Log4j for Spark, Python's logging module)
